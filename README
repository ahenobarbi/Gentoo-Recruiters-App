This will be web based application for Gentoo Recruiters team.

To start testing application you should:

1.Install git.
2.Get sources

  git clone git://git.overlays.gentoo.org/proj/recruiting-webapp.git

  to get accepted sources (recommended). Or if you want latest sources and
  don't mind fact that commit history will be rewritten a few times a day

  git clone git://github.com/ahenobarbi/Gentoo-Recruiters-App.git

3.Install gems. The best way to do it is to have rake install it for you:

  rake gems:install

or if you want to run tests

  RAILS_ENV=test rake gems:install

4.Prepare configuration and databases.

  rake prepare

  You can pass db=sqlite3, db=postgres or db=mysql if you want rake to prepare database configuration for you.
  You can pass seed= if you want rake to seed you database with example data.

5. (Optional) You can run test I prepared by simply issuing

  rake

6. Start server

  ruby script/server

it will be listening for connections on port 3000.

Configuration

In config/config.yml you can set:

  developer_data:
    check                       - Should developer data be checked (Gentoo join time for mentors)
    data                        - String with developer data to use (overrides uri)
    uri                         - URI from which developer data shall be obtained
    min_months_mentor_is_dev: 6 - Number of months mentor must spend as Gentoo Dev before [s]h can became a mentor
  seed:
    users_domain                - Domain for emails of users from default seed

There is example of this file in doc/config/config.yml. Remember to disable checks in cucumber and test environments or tests will fail.

Seed

If you want to edit seed remember you can use erb in db/fixtures/*.yml files.
